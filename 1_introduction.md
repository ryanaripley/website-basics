# Welcome

Note: Hello and welcome!

For those folks who signed up for this class a couple of weeks ago, I really apologize for needing to reschedule. 

If I need to: My wife and I lost our dog unexpectedly that morning. If I had come in, we probably wouldn't have talked about websites. I would have been blubbering incoherently and showing you photos of a Yorkshire terrier instead of a slideshow.

    <p>I've specialized in technology consulting for nonprofits, artists, and arts organizations. I have also been deeply entrenched in the nonprofit arts administration world for over a decade, working at both the Playwrights' Center and Park Square Theatre.</p>

Note: The focus of a majority of my work is building websites that help organizations fulfill their missions...whether that is sharing art, supporting artists, providing information about classes, etc.

I've been on both sides of equation: I have been inside an organization building a website, and the contractor helping build that website. **This has been a huge benefit to me; it has given me empathy for artists and arts organizations who are trying to build a site.

# Website basics

<p class="fragment">View the presentation online at <a href="https://ryanaripley.com/website-basics/">ryanaripley.com/website-basics</a>.</p>

Note: My presentation is  going to be geared toward individuals and organizations with a small budget that don't necessarily have $75k to spend on a new website. That is the audience that I feel gets missed. 

I've attended website or IT sessions and nonprofit-focused conferences that were fascinating case studies about how an organization rebuilt their website--over the course of 18 months and after $150k. 

That's not the realty for small organizations, and with the the current technology out there, it certainly doesn't have to be.

How can you improve your website in the near future with a limited budget?

## Agenda

<p class="fragment" style="margin-top: 2em">Part 1: Content</p>
<p class="fragment">Part 2: Functionality</p>
<p class="fragment">Part 3: Website platforms</p>
<p class="fragment" style="margin-top: 1em">Questions & working session</p>

Note:
- Content: very easy to start with "What will it look like?" "How much will it cost?" Which CMS should I use?" but it's very important to start with "What content is going on my site?"
- Functionality: What does your website need to do?
- Website platforms: WordPress, SquareSpace, Wix, what do I choose? And how much will it cost?

## Introductions

Let's get to know each other.

<ol style="margin-top: 3rem;">
  <li class="fragment">Your name</li>
  <li class="fragment">Your organization (if applicable)</li>
  <li class="fragment">One thing you are hoping to learn today.</li>
</ol>

Note: Once intros are done, ask these questions of group:
- How many folks already have a website?
- At this point, are you planning to do the website by yourself, or to hire someone?
- At what part of the process are you...at the beginning? The middle? Nearing the finish line?
