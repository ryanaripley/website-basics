Note: How does your website work? What does it need to do?

## Four essential features of a website in 2019:

<ol>
  <li class="fragment">It must be responsive (work on all device sizes)</li>
  <li class="fragment">It must load quickly</li>
  <li class="fragment">It must be accessible</li>
  <li class="fragment">It must have a security certificate</li>
</ol>

Note: Show examples of all four.

Why are these so important? You can't assume your user has a really fast computer. A lot of your users probably use their phone as their primary computer. 

SE. Google and other search engines will start docking websites for not having these three things.

## D.R.Y. principle

## Other functionality (yep...make another list)

<ul>
  <li class="fragment">Does your website need a blog?</li>
  <li class="fragment">Does your website need a contact form?</li>
  <li class="fragment">Are you selling anything? Taking donations?</li>
  <li class="fragment">Do you need an events calendar?</li>
  <li class="fragment">Does your website need to connect to a donor or patron database?</li>
<ul>

Note: Each of these things can be nuanced. Describe in detail how you want each thing to function. All of you use websites all day. You're experts. Describe how you want your website to function.

## Finally, what do you like and not like about your current website?

<ul>
  <li class="fragment">What do you like about your current site?</li>
  <li class="fragment">What are the pain points of your current site?</li>
  <li class="fragment">What other sites do you like? Importantly, what do you like about them?</li>
<ul>
